# EARNING SURVEY Visualization Using Power BI

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

# Project Overview:

The primary objective of this project was to evaluate the earnings of Digiskills students within a specific batch. The tasks assigned for this project, as outlined in the attached file, encompassed a range of requirements that aimed to provide comprehensive insights into the earnings distribution among the students. The final presentation was intended for higher authorities.

# Key Tasks and Requirements:

Gender-wise Earning Details:

Analyzing and presenting earnings data based on gender to identify any potential patterns or disparities.
Platform-wise Earning Details:

Assessing earnings across different platforms to understand which avenues are more lucrative for Digiskills students.
Location/City-wise Earning Details:

Analyzing earnings data based on the location or city of the students to identify regional trends.

# Data Transformations and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):

The success of this project relied on the effective utilization of various data transformations and DAX, which are essential components in any data analytics project. Some of the general DAX functions and transformations applied include:

Data Cleaning:

Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency to create a reliable dataset.
Data Aggregation:

Summarizing data by applying aggregation functions to obtain key metrics, such as total earnings, average earnings, etc.
Calculated Columns:

Creating new columns using DAX formulas to derive additional insights from the existing data.
Relationships:

Establishing relationships between different tables in the dataset to facilitate complex analyses.
Conditional Formatting:

Applying conditional formatting to highlight specific data points or trends, enhancing the visual appeal of the presentation.
Measures:

Using DAX measures to calculate specific metrics dynamically based on user requirements.
Visual Representation:

To effectively communicate the findings to stakeholders, various visualizations were employed, including bar charts, pie charts, and geographical maps. Visualization tools such as Power BI or Tableau may have been used to create interactive dashboards for a more immersive and insightful presentation.

# Conclusion:

This project not only addressed the specific requirements outlined in the tasks but also adhered to best practices in data analysis, incorporating robust data transformations, DAX functions, and impactful visualizations. The final presentation aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Digiskills students' earnings within the specified batch, enabling informed decision-making by higher authorities.
